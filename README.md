# Timelocked-Wallet

A Codeacademy Clarity Camp practice project. 

The block height can be used to perform actions over time. 
If you know the average block time, then you can calculate 
roughly how many blocks will be mined in a specific time frame. 
This project uses this concept to create a wallet contract that unlocks 
at a specific block height.
